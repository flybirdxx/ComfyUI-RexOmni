```

## üìñ Usage

### Node Overview

This custom node provides two main components:

1. **Rex-Omni Loader**: Loads and configures Rex-Omni models
2. **Rex-Omni Detector**: Performs inference and returns results

### Basic Workflow

1. **Load Model**: Use the `Rex-Omni Loader` node to load your desired Rex-Omni model
2. **Process Image**: Connect your image to the `Rex-Omni Detector` node
3. **Configure Parameters**: Set task type, confidence threshold, and other parameters
4. **Get Results**: Receive detection results, visualizations, and JSON data

### Node Parameters

#### Rex-Omni Loader
- **Model Name**: Select from available Rex-Omni models
- **Backend**: Choose between "transformers" or "vllm"
- **Max Tokens**: Maximum number of tokens for text generation (1-4096)
- **Temperature**: Sampling temperature for text generation (0.0-2.0)

#### Rex-Omni Detector
- **Model**: Connect the loaded model from Rex-Omni Loader
- **Image**: Input image for processing
- **Task Type**: Type of task to perform (detection, recognition, etc.)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence for detections (0.0-1.0)
- **Max Results**: Maximum number of results to return
- **Show Labels**: Whether to show labels in visualization
- **Show Confidence**: Whether to show confidence scores in visualization

### Output Types

The detector node provides multiple output types:

1. **Detection Results**: Structured detection data
2. **Visualization Image**: Annotated image with detections
3. **JSON Data**: Formatted JSON output for further processing
4. **Bounding Boxes**: Extracted bounding box coordinates
5. **Text Results**: Extracted text content
6. **Keypoints**: Detected keypoint coordinates

## üéØ Supported Tasks

- **Object Detection**: Detect and localize objects in images
- **Text Recognition**: Extract and recognize text from images
- **Keypoint Detection**: Detect human pose keypoints
- **Image Classification**: Classify images into categories
- **Visual Question Answering**: Answer questions about images
- **Image Captioning**: Generate descriptive captions for images

## üìä Example Workflow

The following workflow demonstrates the Rex-Omni nodes in action, showcasing multiple computer vision tasks:

![Rex-Omni Workflow Example](example_workflow/workflow.png)

This example workflow shows:
- **Object Detection**: Detecting people in images with bounding boxes
- **Localization**: Precise pointing and localization tasks
- **Keypoint Detection**: Detailed human pose keypoint extraction
- **OCR**: Text recognition with polygon-based word detection

### Example Workflow Files

You can find the following files in the `example_workflow/` directory:
- `example_workflow.json` - Complete workflow configuration file
- `workflow.png` - Workflow visualization image
- Various test image files

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Not Found**: Ensure models are placed in the correct directory
2. **CUDA Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size or use CPU backend
3. **Import Errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed correctly
